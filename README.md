# Ad-Click Prediction
A company wants to know the CTR ( Click Through Rate ) in order to identify whether spending their money on digital advertising is worth or not.
<br>Click Through rate (CTR) is a metric that measures the number of clicks advertisers receive on their ads per number of impressions.

 ### Steps involved:
 - [ ] Importing dataset
   * [CTR Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data?select=test.gz)
   
 - [ ] Dataset analysis
 
 - [ ] How we are going to solve this problem?
    <br>We'll use binary classification (implemented using Logistic Regression) of whether a given ad on a given page will be clicked by a given user, with predictive features from the following aspects: 
    * ***Ad content and information*** (category, position, text, format, and so on) 
    * ***Page content and publisher information*** (category, context, domain, and so on) 
    * ***User information*** (age, gender, location, income, interests, search history, browsing history, device, and so on)
